# Omnnis sys(*) function

## sys(237) - Selected Method

If the current editor is the top window and a single method is selected, returns an item reference to the selected method, otherwhise returns empty.

```omnis
Set reference lirCurrentMethod to sys(237)
If not(isclear(lirCurrentMethod))
    Calculate lcMethodNotation as lirCurrentMethod.$fullname()
End If
```

## sys(185) - Currently executing method

Returns the name of the current executing method in the format `LibraryName.Classname/MethodName/Linennumber`

For instance, if the currently executing method is `$event` of a GUI components, it returns:

```
Calcualte lcCurrentMethod as sys(185)
; lcCurrentMethod = CodeBookmarks.mnu_Bookmark/1/$event/15
```

where:

- `CodeBookmars` is the library name
- `mnu_Bookmark` is the class which contains the method
- `1` is (probably the instance which is executing the method, but this is not in the official documentation)
- `$event` is the method name
- `15` is the executing line (the one with the `Calculate ... as sys(185)`)


##Â sys(194) - Open IDE windows

Returns the list of the open windows in the IDE. The list has the following columns:

- `windowname`: the name of the window, as it would apper in the windows menu;
- `classitem`: if the windows it a class or method editor, the item reference to the class; otherwhise `#NULL`.
- `methodeditor`: boolean, true if and only if the window is a method editor window.

The current line of the list is non-zero if and only if the window is the top design window, i.e. the top class editor or method editor window. When deciding the top window, the catalog, component store, and propertyinspector are ignored (the `Variable ...` windows is not ignored). 

The result list also consider all the user defined windows which are open.

```
Do sys(194) Returns lvList
```

Gives a list:

----
| | windowname|classitem|methodeditor|*comment*|
|----|-----|-|-|-|
| 1C | Menu CodeBookMarks... | `$root.$libs.CodeBookmarks.$menus.mnu_Bookmark` | True| *Method editor instance*|
| 2 | Variable lvList | `#NULL` | False | *variable value inspection* |
| 3 | Bookmars | `#NULL` | False | *user definded window*|
| 4 | Studio Browser | `#NULL` | False |
